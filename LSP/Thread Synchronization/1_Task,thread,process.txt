// 1. What is the difference between a Task, Process and thread?

Task:
    A task is a set of program instructions that are loaded in memory.
    
Thread:
    A thread is merely a process that shares certain resources with other processes.
    (which just happens to share resources, such as an addressspace, with other processes)
    
Process:
    A process is an “an address space with one or more threads executing within that addressspace,and the required system resources for those threads.”
