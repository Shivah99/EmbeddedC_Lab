// Do you have any idea about thread safe? How can you implement it?

     When a thread is running using global variables there occurs 
•Data Inconsistency
•Loss of Data
•Race around conditions changes the value of the variable in a process.
     
     To make a thread safe the following are Solution:
     
    1.Using signals to synchronize on producer and consumer threads.
    2.Synchronization Mechanisms like 
        a)Semaphore: A semaphore is an unsigned integer variable which acts as "atomic (non-preemptive) Variable".
        
        b)Mutex: A Mutex is a lock that we set before using a shared resource and release after using it. When the lock is set, no other thread can access the locked region of code.
