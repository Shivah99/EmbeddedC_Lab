Mini Project - GNU Tool Chain 
a. Assume that you are working on a calculator project contained in the directory calculator.
 under this directory there are several subdirectories with names
  "lib","doc","inc“,"src“ and “bin”.
b. The objective is to create a top level Makefile in the calculator directory 
and each of the source code directories: lib and src.
c. The include directory contains the header files for the project and
 does not need a Makefile as these don't have to be compiled separately.
d. When make is invoked in the calculator directory it should automatically 
invoke the Makefile in each of the src directories automatically and build a library
 in the "lib" directory and two executables in each of "src" directory.
e. Create any source files with all their header files in the include directory.
