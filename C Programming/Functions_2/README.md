    1)  Write a function ,that can take two integers, swap their values and print their new values.return type should be void.
    2)  Write a program with a function that takes two integer arguments, and prints all prime numbers between those numbers using the prime number function written above.return type should be void.
        PrintAllPrimes - return type is void. Should use IsPrime() function from #3
    3   )Write a function that takes an integer parameter and prints its multiplication table.return type should be void.
    4)  Write a function to accept a date and return 1 if the date is valid. 0 otherwise.
    5)  Write a program to take input of month, year, total salary and number of LOP days as input and calculate the salary of an employee.
            eg.,
            input : month: 1 , year: 2019 , total salary: 10000, lops : 4
            net salary : 8709/-
            (Hint: Calculate one day salary, multiply with number of lops, subtract from total salary)
    6)  Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns the reverse of the integer as output.
         print the reverse number in main function.
    7)  Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns the number of digits as output. Use do while loop.
        return 1 if the input is 0. should return the count for negative numbers also.
    8)  Write a program to read roll number and marks of 10 students in 3 subjects.
            The valid range for roll numbers is
            1000-9999, if the roll number entered is not in this range, the user should be asked to enter again.
            Calculate total marks of only those students who get more than or equal to 40 marks in each subject.
            Count the number of students whose total is more than 200.
            Print the roll number of the student who gets the highest total.
    9)  Write a function to take the input as number of terms, and return the sum of the following series upto the given number of terms:
            eg., input number of terms: 4
            output : 1 + 11 + 111 + 1111
