    1	"Try experimenting with the below array syntaxes and see the results,check their sizes, try to also read values for elements and print them:</br> 
        int arr[5] = {}; 
        int arr[10] = {2.4,5.6,7.3};
        int arr[3] = {1,2,3,4,5};
        int arr[0] = {};
        int arr[0] = {1,2,3,4,5};
        int arr[] = {};
        int arr[‘a’];"
    
    2)	"Write the following program.
        Declare an integer variable ‘size’. 
        Take the value of ‘size’ from user using scanf.
        Declare an array of any datatype, and give the integer variable ‘size’, in place of size of the array  and 
        initialize it to some values.(syntax: float array[size] = {1.0,2.5};)
        Using for loop, try to take user input using scanf. Loop should execute ‘size’ number of times.
        Using for loop, print the elements of the array."
    
    3)	"Write a program to print an array in reverse order
        Input : array1 ={1,2,3,4,5};
        Output : array1 = {5,4,3,2,1};"
    
    4)      "Write a program to reverse an array and print it:  
        Input : array1 ={1,2,3,4,5};
        Output : array1 = {5,4,3,2,1};"
    
    5)Write a program to print an integer in binary format.
    
    6)"Write a program to swap two arrays in reverse order.
        "
        
        eg., array1 = {1,2,3,4,5};
        array2 = { 6,7,8,9,10};
    
        output
        
        array1 = {10,9,8,7,6}
        array2 = {5,4,3,2,1}
        
    7) Write a code in C to receive an array of different integer values, and produce another array(list)
    of only the duplicated values in the original array, if a duplicate value is found more than once, 
    the list shall only show one value, order is not important.
    
    8)an array contains some numbers. You need to find out how many times the biggest number has occurred in that array.
