##### Date 13-08-2021

        1)	Write a program to find the biggest of three numbers using if else statements.
        2)	C program to check and print whether a number is positive, negative or zero
        3)	Write a program to find the biggest of four numbers.
        4)	Write a calculator program that takes two integer numbers from user, and one of the operands +,-,* and / as a character and prints the appropriate result using if else.
        5)	Find the power bill for the input number of units :
                0 - 200 units : 100/- min
                201 - 400 units : 100 + 0.65 per unit excess of 200
                401 - 600 units : 230 + 0.80 per unit excess of 400
                601 and above units : 390 + 1.00 per unit excess of 600
        6)	Find the % of marks for 6 subjects, for a student, and print the grade of the student as per below division , using if else statement.
                80 - 100        : Honours
                60 - 79         : First Division
                50 - 59         : Second Division
                40 - 49         : Third Division
                0 - 39          : Fail
        7)	check if a character is alphabet or not
        8)	check if a character is vowel or not
        9)	check if an year is leap year or not.
        10)	An ATM gives money in denominations of 500, 100, 50 ,20 and 10 /-. Given an amount, print how many notes of each denomination will be released. Amount entered must be a multiple of 10, otherwise give an error message. 
        print only the denominations that are dispensed, do not print the denominations with 0 number of notes.
        11)Read the marks for 6 subjects as integers, and calculate the percentage with 2 digit precision. Print the grade of the student as per below division, using if else statement.
                80 - 100                         : Honours
                60 - 80(not including 80)        : First Division
                50 - 60(not including 60)        : Second Division
                40 - 50(not including 50)        : Third Division
                0 - 40(not including 40)         : Fail
        12)"Write a program that reads a floating-point number and then displays the right-most digit of the integral part of the number.
            (Eg: User enters, 456.789, the output should be 6, which is last digit of the integral part of the number)."
        13)"Input 3 digits, read them into three different characters. Make one integer out of them and display.
            Eg., input 345. char c =‘3’,b=‘4’,d=‘5’. 
            Output : int i = 345."
        14) Write a program to print the size of various data types in C.
