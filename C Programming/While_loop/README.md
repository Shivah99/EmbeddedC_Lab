##### Date 21-08-2021
        1)Write a program to print all numbers from 1 to n.
        
        2)Write a program to print all odd numbers and even numbers from m to n(both in same program, one after the other).
        
        3)"Write a program to input n numbers and print the largest and smallest numbers out of them.
        
                Eg., 3,23,56,34,78,45,26,90,68,77
                Biggest Number is 90
                Smallest Number is 3"
        
        4)"Write a program to input a number and count the digits in it.
                Eg. 
                0 - number of digits 1
                12 – number of digits 2
                155 – number of digits 3"
        
        5)Modify the calculator program to perform the operations continuously until the user chooses not to continue further.
        
        6)"Modify the Calculator Program to perform multiplication, Division, and modulus Operations
        With out using the symbls *,/ and % or any library functions related to these operations"
        
        7)Write a program to find out if an integer entered by a user is a prime number or not.
        
        8)"Write a program to find the factorial of a given number.
                N! = n * n-1 * n-2 * …. 2 * 1"
        9)"Write a program to print the first n Fibonacci numbers.
        
                Eg., First 8 Fibonacci numbers are :
                1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21 "
                
        10)Write a program to find the value a given number raised to a given positive integer power.
        read to integers and find the power of the first integer raised to the second integer.
                eg., 3  4
                out: 81
