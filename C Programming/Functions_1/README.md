##### Date 27-08-2021

        1)  Write a function that takes principle, rate of interest and time in months as input arguments, and returns the total amount to be repayed, after calculation of simple interest.
        
        2)  Modify the calculator program - with functions ,Add(),Sub(),Mul(),Div(),Mod(). Each function should take the inputs as parameters and return the result as output.
                Hint: int add(int , int); 
                int sub (int, int);
        
        3)  write a function that can take an integer as input and return 1, if the number is prime number and 0 if it is not prime and print appropriate output message.
             return type is integer.
                IsPrime - returns int (0,1)
        
        4)  Write a function to determine if a character is alphanumeric or not. 
                Hint: int fun_alpha_num(char c)
        
        5)  Write a function that takes two numbers, a and n as input arguments and returns the value of a to the power of n.
        
        6)  Write a function to accept a year as input and return 1 if the year is a leap year, otherwise 0.
            
        7)  Write a function to accept two dates as input arguments, and return 1 if the first date is older, 0 if the second date is older. print appropriate message in main function.
        
        8)  Write a function that accepts a month and year as input, and returns the number of days of the month as output. Print the number of days in a given month and year.
        
        9)  Write a function to accept a character as input, return the upper case character, if the given character is a lower case alphabet, otherwise return the character as it is.
            char ToUpper(char );
        
        10) Write a function to return the product of two numbers without using * operator.
